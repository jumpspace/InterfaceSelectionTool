==============================================
CENTRALSQUARE INTERFACE SELECTION TOOL (InSeT)
==============================================

The Interface Selection Tool is written to ease the creation of 
CentralSquare/FDM RMS customizations. Interface scripts are 
divided by module (Incident, Property, Permit, etc.) and mode 
(Import, Export). Use the Interface Selection Tool to determine 
which scripts to use to build the customization for the client. 

This tool is written in C# using Visual Studio 2017 Community 
Edition.
